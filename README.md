# Boston Airbnb Analysis - Data Visualization with PowerBI 
## üí™ Motivation:
This project was created to showcase my data analysis and visualization skills that I have acquired from two years working experience as a consultant at a big four firm. 


## üìä Dataset Used:
Kaggle Boston AirBnb data https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/boston.
For this project, three datasets were used for the data analysis and visualizations: 
* listings.csv, including accomendation information, descriptions, reviews, and scores of each listing
* reviews.csv, including accomendation reviews, and reviewer ID
* calendar.csv, including listing id and the price and availability for that day

## ‚ùî Business Questions:
After diving deep into the datasets, the business questions came across, which will be analyzed later during the project: 
* How many Airbnb accomendations are listed in Boston? Among them, how many were hosted by Superhosts?
* What are the factors that has an impact on the accomendation price in Boston?
* What is the most expensive neighboorhood to stay in Boston?
* Which neighboorhoods are scored highests in reviews?
* Is there a major price differnece in different property types? How about in different number of bedrooms?
